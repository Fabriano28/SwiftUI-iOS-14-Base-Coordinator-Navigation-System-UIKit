# iOS Scalable Architecture (Proof of Concept)

Welcome! This repository is a proof-of-concept demonstrating a scalable, modular, and testable architecture for SwiftUI applications that support **iOS 14+**.

The patterns implemented here are based on the principles of state-driven navigation, the Coordinator pattern, and a clean separation of concerns through feature-specific Dependency Injection.
